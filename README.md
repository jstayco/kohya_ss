# Kohya's GUI

This repository provides a Windows-focused Gradio GUI for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion trainers](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). The GUI allows you to set the training parameters and generate and run the required CLI commands to train the model.

If you run on Linux and would like to use the GUI, there is now a port of it as a docker container. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/P2Enjoy/kohya_ss-docker).

**By default this project uses Torch v1 and an automated installation procedure. If you'd like to customize the options, please check the [Configuration](#configuration) section.**

## Installation and Upgrading
### Required Prerequisites

These dependencies are taken care of via `setup.ps1` or `setup.sh` for your respective operating system.

**No additional steps should be needed unless the scripts inform you otherwise**. 

However, for reference:

- [Python 3.10 for Windows](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe) 
  - Make sure to tick the box to add Python to the 'PATH' environment variable
- [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

On Linux you may need to use your package manager to install these. On macOS we suggest you use [brew](https://brew.sh/).
The VS Redistributable component is not needed for non-Windows operating systems.

<br>

### macOS, Windows, Linux, BSD
To set up and install the application, use the provided setup scripts depending on your operating system:

Windows: Use **<ins>setup.ps1</ins>**. 

- **<ins>setup.bat</ins>** is also available, but considered legacy and may be deprecated in the future.

Non-Windows: Use **<ins>setup.sh</ins>** or if you have pwsh available use **<ins>setup.ps1</ins>** .

<br>

### Running Kohya_SS

There are many configuration options which you can find just below this section. Here are some examples on how to run the scripts. They also have help functions.

Default Settings: 
```bash
# Windows
setup.ps1

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
setup.sh
```

Custom Settings:
```bash
# Windows
setup.ps1 -Listen 192.168.1.100 -Username myusername -Password mypassword -ServerPort 8000 -Interactive $true -RunPod $true `
-Branch mybranch -Dir "C:\path\to\kohya_ss" -GitRepo "https://github.com/myfork/kohya_ss.git"

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
setup.sh -l 192.168.1.100 -u myusername -p mypassword -s 8000 -i -r \
--branch mybranch --dir "/path/to/kohya_ss" --git_repo "https://github.com/myfork/kohya_ss.git"
```

Read Help Documentation:
```bash
# Windows
Get-Help ./setup.ps1 -Full

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
setup.sh [-h | --help]

# Universal
launcher.py [-h | --help]
```


<details>
<summary><h4 id="bypass-some">Bypass Python, git, and tk checks. Keep Python venv and dependency validations.</h4></summary>

Bypass Python, git, and tk checks by running launcher.py:
```bash
# Windows
python .\launcher.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000 --interactive --runpod `
--branch mybranch --dir "C:\path\to\kohya_ss" --git_repo "https://github.com/myfork/kohya_ss.git"

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
launcher.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000 --interactive --runpod \
--branch mybranch --dir "/path/to/kohya_ss" --git_repo "https://github.com/myfork/kohya_ss.git"
```

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="bypass-most">Bypass all setup steps, installation checks, and Python validations.</h4></summary>

The -n or --no-setup options bypass all setup and checks:
```bash
# Windows
python .\launcher.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000 --no-setup

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
launcher.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000 --no-setup
```

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="bypass-all">Bypass everything and run Kohya directly.</h4></summary>

Kohya GUI will also respect the configuration file like all other scripts:
```bash
# Windows
python .\kohya_gui.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000

# Linux / macOS / Cygwin, Msys, etc
kohya_gui.py --listen 192.168.1.100 --username myusername --password mypassword --server_port 8000
```

</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary><h4 id="permission-errors">Permission Errors when running setup.ps1</h4></summary>

Try the following command in PowerShell:
```pwsh
$Policy = Get-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser; 
if ($Policy -eq "Restricted" -or $Policy -eq "AllSigned") { 
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force 
}
```

This command does the following:

1. Retrieves the current execution policy for the current user.
2. If the policy is set to Restricted or AllSigned, it changes the policy to RemoteSigned for the current user only, allowing local unsigned scripts to run. The -Force flag is used to bypass the confirmation prompt.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3 id="containers">Containers</h3></summary>

To build a container, ensure you have installed the pre-reqs and then you can put this in your build file or script:

```bash
launcher.py --setup-only
```

To run in a container put this as the entry point:

```bash
launcher.py --no-setup
```

<summary><h5 id="configuration-file">Configuration File</h5></summary>

You may now specify configuration files to load values from. An example configuration file is placed at $installation/config_files/installation/install_config.yml.
The scripts will load values in the following priority order:
1. Command Line Arguments
2. Configuration File specified via command line with --file
3. $HOME/.kohya_ss/install_config.yml
4. $ScriptDirectory/install_config.yml
5. $ScriptDirectory/config_files/installation/install_config.yml
6. Default values hard-coded in script

Therefore, values that are placed in $HOME/.kohya_ss/install_config.yml will override values found in $ScriptDirectory/config_files/installation/install_config.yml.
This allows you to have user-level definitions, project-level definitions, and run-time definitions.

<summary><h2 id="optional-cuddn-86">Optional: CUDNN 8.6</h2></summary>


This step is optional but can improve the learning speed for NVIDIA 30X0/40X0 owners. It allows for larger training batch size and faster training speed.

Due to the file size, I can't host the DLLs needed for CUDNN 8.6 on Github. I strongly advise you download them for a speed boost in sample generation (almost 50% on 4090 GPU) you can download them [here](https://b1.thefileditch.ch/mwxKTEtelILoIbMbruuM.zip).

To install, simply unzip the directory and place the `cudnn_windows` folder in the root of the this repo.

Run the following commands to install:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate

python .\tools\cudann_1.8_install.py
```

</details>

## Dreambooth

You can find the dreambooth solution specific here: [Dreambooth README](train_db_README.md)

## Finetune

You can find the finetune solution specific here: [Finetune README](fine_tune_README.md)

## Train Network

You can find the train network solution specific here: [Train network README](train_network_README.md)

## LoRA

Training a LoRA currently uses the `train_network.py` code. You can create a LoRA network by using the all-in-one `gui.cmd` or by running the dedicated LoRA training GUI with:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate

python lora_gui.py
```

Once you have created the LoRA network, you can generate images via auto1111 by installing [this extension](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks).

### Naming of LoRA

The LoRA supported by `train_network.py` has been named to avoid confusion. The documentation has been updated. The following are the names of LoRA types in this repository.

1. __LoRA-LierLa__ : (LoRA for __Li__ n __e__ a __r__  __La__ yers)

    LoRA for Linear layers and Conv2d layers with 1x1 kernel

2. __LoRA-C3Lier__ : (LoRA for __C__ olutional layers with __3__ x3 Kernel and  __Li__ n __e__ a __r__ layers)

    In addition to 1., LoRA for Conv2d layers with 3x3 kernel 
    
LoRA-LierLa is the default LoRA type for `train_network.py` (without `conv_dim` network arg). LoRA-LierLa can be used with [our extension](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks) for AUTOMATIC1111's Web UI, or with the built-in LoRA feature of the Web UI.

To use LoRA-C3Lier with Web UI, please use our extension.

## Sample image generation during training
A prompt file might look like this, for example

```
# prompt 1
masterpiece, best quality, (1girl), in white shirts, upper body, looking at viewer, simple background --n low quality, worst quality, bad anatomy,bad composition, poor, low effort --w 768 --h 768 --d 1 --l 7.5 --s 28

# prompt 2
masterpiece, best quality, 1boy, in business suit, standing at street, looking back --n (low quality, worst quality), bad anatomy,bad composition, poor, low effort --w 576 --h 832 --d 2 --l 5.5 --s 40
```

  Lines beginning with `#` are comments. You can specify options for the generated image with options like `--n` after the prompt. The following can be used.

  * `--n` Negative prompt up to the next option.
  * `--w` Specifies the width of the generated image.
  * `--h` Specifies the height of the generated image.
  * `--d` Specifies the seed of the generated image.
  * `--l` Specifies the CFG scale of the generated image.
  * `--s` Specifies the number of steps in the generation.

  The prompt weighting such as `( )` and `[ ]` are working.

## Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><h3 id="page-file-limit">Page File Limit</h3></summary>

- X error relating to `page file`: Increase the page file size limit in Windows.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3 id="no-module-called-tkinter">No Module Called TKinter</h3></summary>

- Re-run the install script or manually install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe) on your system.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3 id="filenotfound-error">FileNotFound Error</h3></summary>

This is usually related to an installation issue. Make sure you do not have any python modules installed locally that could conflict with the ones installed in the venv:

1. Open a new powershell terminal and make sure no venv is active.
2.  Run the following commands:

```
pip freeze > uninstall.txt
pip uninstall -r uninstall.txt
```

This will store your a backup file with your current locally installed pip packages and then uninstall them. Then, redo the installation instructions within the kohya_ss venv.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3 id="deleting-downloaded-model-cache">Deleting Downloaded Model Cache</h3></summary>

By default huggingface stores its downloaded models in 

- Non-Windows: `$HOME/.cache/huggingface`
- Windows: `$env:USERPROFILE/.cache/huggingface`

If you are going to delete the models, it is advised to shutdown the software while you do so.

</details>


### Installation Issues

<details>
<summary><h3 id="debug-mode">Debug Mode</h3></summary>
In order to run debug mode you can enable that on any script as such:

```bash
# By default they will store the logs in your kohya_ss install folder /logs.
setup.ps1 -Debug

setup.bat --verbosity 3

setup.sh -vvv

launcher.py -vvv

# You may configure any one of these scripts to output to a custom log directory
setup.ps1 -Debug -LogDIr C:\my\custom\folder
setup.sh -vvv --log-dir /my/custom/folder
```

Combine the appropriate debug switch with whatever switches and values are appropriate for your configuration or deployment.
</details>

<details>
<summary><h3 id="general-installation-workflow">General Installation Workflow</h3></summary>

1. Run setup.ps1 on Windows or setup.sh on non-Windows operating systems with the desired command-line arguments.
2. The setup script will execute launcher.py with the same arguments.
3. launcher.py will pass the command-line arguments through to kohya_gui.py, which will use these arguments to configure the GUI and other settings according to your preferences.

Now the workflow is complete, and your application is set up and configured. 
You can run launcher.py whenever you want to launch the application with the specified settings.

#### Latest Release
* 2023/04/10 (v21.5.11)
  - Make docker headless @Trojaner
  - Add functions to catch `null` values in json config files

</details>

<details>
<summary>21.5</summary>

* 2023/07/11 (v21.5.11)
  - Added an option `--dim_from_weights` to `train_network.py` to automatically determine the dim(rank) from the weight file. [PR #491](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/491) Thanks to AI-Casanova!
    - It is useful in combination with `resize_lora.py`. Please see the PR for details.
  - Fixed a bug where the noise resolution was incorrect with Multires noise. [PR #489](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/489) Thanks to sdbds!
    - Please see the PR for details.
  - The image generation scripts can now use img2img and highres fix at the same time.
  - Fixed a bug where the hint image of ControlNet was incorrectly BGR instead of RGB in the image generation scripts.
  - Added a feature to the image generation scripts to use the memory-efficient VAE.
    - If you specify a number with the `--vae_slices` option, the memory-efficient VAE will be used. The maximum output size will be larger, but it will be slower. Please specify a value of about `16` or `32`.
    - The implementation of the VAE is in `library/slicing_vae.py`.
* 2023/04/09 (v21.5.10)
  - Fix issue https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss/issues/734
  - The documentation has been moved to the `docs` folder. If you have links, please change them.
  - DAdaptAdaGrad, DAdaptAdan, and DAdaptSGD are now supported by DAdaptation. [PR#455](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/455) Thanks to sdbds!
    - DAdaptation needs to be installed. Also, depending on the optimizer, DAdaptation may need to be updated. Please update with `pip install --upgrade dadaptation`.
  - Added support for pre-calculation of LoRA weights in image generation scripts. Specify `--network_pre_calc`.
    - The prompt option `--am` is available. Also, it is disabled when Regional LoRA is used.
  - Added Adaptive noise scale to each training script. Specify a number with `--adaptive_noise_scale` to enable it.
    - __Experimental option. It may be removed or changed in the future.__
    - This is an original implementation that automatically adjusts the value of the noise offset according to the absolute value of the mean of each channel of the latents. It is expected that appropriate noise offsets will be set for bright and dark images, respectively.
    - Specify it together with `--noise_offset`.
    - The actual value of the noise offset is calculated as `noise_offset + abs(mean(latents, dim=(2,3))) * adaptive_noise_scale`. Since the latent is close to a normal distribution, it may be a good idea to specify a value of about 1/10 to the same as the noise offset.
    - Negative values can also be specified, in which case the noise offset will be clipped to 0 or more.
  - Other minor fixes.
* 2023/04/06 (v21.5.9)
  - Implement headless mode to enable easier support under headless services like vast.ai. To make use of it start the gui with the `--headless` argument like:

    `.\gui.ps1 --headless` or `.\gui.bat --headless` or `./gui.sh --headless`
  - Added the option for the user to put the wandb api key in a textbox under the advanced configuration dropdown and a checkbox to toggle for using wandb logging. @x-CK-x

    - Replace pillow with pillow-simd
    - Removed --no-cache again as pip cache is not enabled anyway
  - While overwriting .txt files with prefix and postfix including different encodings you might encounter this decoder error. This small fix gets rid of it... @ertugrul-dmr
  - Docker Add --no-cache-dir to reduce image size @chiragjn
  - Reverting bitsandbytes version to 0.35.0 due to issues with 0.38.1 on some systems
* 2023/04/05 (v21.5.8)
  - Add `Cache latents to disk` option to the gui.
  - When saving v2 models in Diffusers format in training scripts and conversion scripts, it was found that the U-Net configuration is different from those of Hugging Face's stabilityai models (this repository is `"use_linear_projection": false`, stabilityai is `true`). Please note that the weight shapes are different, so please be careful when using the weight files directly. We apologize for the inconvenience.
      - Since the U-Net model is created based on the configuration, it should not cause any problems in training or inference.
      - Added `--unet_use_linear_projection` option to `convert_diffusers20_original_sd.py` script. If you specify this option, you can save a Diffusers format model with the same configuration as stabilityai's model from an SD format model (a single `*.safetensors` or `*.ckpt` file). Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert a Diffusers format model to the same format.
  - Lion8bit optimizer is supported. [PR #447](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/447) Thanks to sdbds!
    - Currently it is optional because you need to update `bitsandbytes` version. See "Optional: Use Lion8bit" in installation instructions to use it.
  - Multi-GPU training with DDP is supported in each training script. [PR #448](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/448) Thanks to Isotr0py!
  - Multi resolution noise (pyramid noise) is supported in each training script. [PR #471](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/471) Thanks to pamparamm!
    - See PR and this page [Multi-Resolution Noise for Diffusion Model Training](https://wandb.ai/johnowhitaker/multires_noise/reports/Multi-Resolution-Noise-for-Diffusion-Model-Training--VmlldzozNjYyOTU2) for details.

  - Added `--save_every_n_steps` option to each training script. The model is saved every specified steps.
    - `--save_last_n_steps` option can be used to save only the specified number of models (old models will be deleted).
    - If you specify the `--save_state` option, the state will also be saved at the same time. You can specify the number of steps to keep the state with the `--save_last_n_steps_state` option (the same value as `--save_last_n_steps` is used if omitted).
    - You can use the epoch-based model saving and state saving options together.
    - Not tested in multi-GPU environment. Please report any bugs.
  - `--cache_latents_to_disk` option automatically enables `--cache_latents` option when specified. [#438](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/issues/438)

    - Added support for caching latents to disk in each training script. Please specify __both__ `--cache_latents` and `--cache_latents_to_disk` options.
        - The files are saved in the same folder as the images with the extension `.npz`. If you specify the `--flip_aug` option, the files with `_flip.npz` will also be saved.
        - Multi-GPU training has not been tested.
        - This feature is not tested with all combinations of datasets and training scripts, so there may be bugs.
